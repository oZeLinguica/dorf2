# DORF2

Dorf2 is the codename of hitherto unnamed Godot project #1 by yours truly. This is a repository for the source code. I have no idea if I'm doing this right.

The code is suboptimal. I am by no means an expert at programming, and a lot of it was brute forced through trial and error. There are a lot of redundant scripts that aren't really attached to anything and the file structure is absolutely insane. Enjoy your stay.
